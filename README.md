# Tools Rental E-Commerce Platform

## Idea
Some jobs require specific tools to do it. Sometimes we do not have these tools. So we go and buy them, use them once, and never use them again. This results in a loss of money and lots of harm to the environment.

This project aims to create an online e-commerce platform that allows people to rent their tools to others. This prevents people from having to buy new tools and helps owners get some profit out of theirs.
