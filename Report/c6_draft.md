# chapter 6 conclusion
For 11 months from 3rd February 2021 to 6th December 2021, I have researched, designed, and built this system called "Rentool" which achieved its goals of providing an online platfrom for users to create account where they can offer their tools for rent and to rent other users' tools.

The used development model is the incremental and iterative model. Chosen due to missing requirements due to the lack of knowledge and expirence in building e-commerce and rental platforms.

The system is deployed on three apps, an Android app, an iOS app, and a web app hosted on https://rentool.site. The system's backend is deployed with Firebase, with Firestore as the database, Cloud functions for running backend code which gets triggered by multiple triggers including changes in the database. or the creation of a new user account. or by calling them directly. Cloud Storage for storing the pictures videos and any other files the system needs. Firebase Cloud Messaging for sending push notifications to users' devices. And Firebase Hosting for hosting the web app. The system allow the user to serach for a tool. This is done using Algolia where Cloud functinos would creation update and delete of tools and update Algolia.

The system handles payments between the owners and renters using Checkout. Checkout is a payment gateway that allows money to be sent from and to users' credit and debit cards. The system has a webhook with Checkout servers using `CF:payments` which listens to events sent from Checkout like a payment being captured or declined, and handles it appropiatley.

To offer a tool the user would have to verify his/her email address, set his/her national ID number, and add a credit/debit card that supports payouts. Then the user can create a tool document in the 'Tools' collection where users who also had set an ID number and added a credit/debit card can send requests to. Then the owner would review these requests where he can reject them or accpet one of them. after that the owner and renter would meet to deliver the tool and after the renter is done they would meet to return the tool. Here the owner can claim the tool is damaged and create a disagreement case that an admin would have to review and decide if it was indeed damaged or not.
